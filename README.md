 Projects
 • Plate-To-Health: A Global Nutritional Journey — Python, Data Exploration & Analysis (Website Link):
 ◦ Cleaned and processed dietary data from Global Dietary Database, removing duplicates, outliers, and applying undersam
pling.
 ◦ Developed and fine-tuned regression models (e.g., KNN, XGBoost, Random Forest) by optimizing hyperparameters to
 improve model accuracy.
 ◦ Levaraged Bayesian model with optimized parameters, achieving an R² score of 1.0000 for predicting dietary factors based
 on age, gender, and education.
 ◦ Created visualizations and website to communicate insights for public health strategies.
 • Air Quality Analysis: Predictive and Statistical Modeling, Statistical Insights (Paper Link):
 ◦ Cleaned and analyzed 9,357 hourly air quality records, identifying trends and correlations.
 ◦ Conducted ANOVA to reveal significant pollutant variations across time and conditions.
 ◦ Built predictive models (Linear, Ridge, and Random Forest), with Random Forest achieving 98.47% R² for NO prediction.
 ◦ Documented the study in a comprehensive, official paper format, ensuring clarity and professionalism.
 • Estimating Soil Nutrient Deficiency using IOT for Paddy Crops — Data Collection, Python, Machine Learning:
 ◦ Collected data by visiting Paddy Field; manually capturing each paddy crop leaf image and collecting the NPK values of
 each respective leaf using IOT sensor.
 ◦ Designed and developed a multiple linear regression model to predict NPK nutrient levels based on the paddy crop leaf’s
 external composition, processing over 10000 visual images
 ◦ Created a user-friendly web interface that instantly generates the NPK values when a visual image of crop leaf is given as
 input
